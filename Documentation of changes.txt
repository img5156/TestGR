- Included print statement in IMRPhenomHMPhase function
- Implemented the iPython notebook Abhirup sent to obtain the outputed print statements
- Implemented the if command but with manually provided values of nonGR parameters. Works.
- Manually chnaged nonGR parameters: 0, 0.1 and 0.2 in the if loop and plotted and compared the abs(h) and phase for all of them compared to the GR case. Works.
